# Oasis Infobyte Internship - Task Completion

This repository contains the completed tasks for the Oasis Infobyte internship. In this internship, I had the opportunity to work on various tasks at different levels, and I selected Level-2 for my project.

## Task Details

### Task 1: Calculator App

In this task, I developed a calculator web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator allows users to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The interface is user-friendly and responsive.

### Task 2: Tribute Page - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar

For the second task, I created a tribute page dedicated to Dr. B. R. Ambedkar. The page provides information about Dr. Ambedkar's life, achievements, and contributions. It includes a visually appealing design and relevant content to honor his significant impact.

### Task 3: Todo Web App

The third task involved building a todo web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The todo app allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them when necessary. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for managing and organizing tasks effectively.
